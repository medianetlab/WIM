# Rules Script Repository

Store the scripts that will be called by the WIM in order to establish connectivity between end points. Each script should accept one argument. If the argument is "create", it will create the SDN rules to establish connectivity between the endpoints. If the argument is "delete", it will delete the created SDN rules in order to terminate the connectivity between the endpoints
